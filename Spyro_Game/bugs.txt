BUGS:

Fireball moves relative to Spyro,
so if it's fired one way and Spyro walks the other way,
the fireball will follow him slowly.

Score will continue to increase after Game Over
if fireballs hit enemies when the screen is up.

Spyro teleports to the top of the first platform,
regardless of which side he walks from. It always
happens at the left end of the platform.

No double jump?

Background scrolling ends at the same time as the level.

Spyro can walk under the ground and never die.

Gravity height scales with x-position;
Spyro jumps higher in the middle of the stage.
